# Recruitment management toolkit

Audio-visual enabled recruitment framework, which assesses candidates automatically based on their responses, skill assessment, and their CV.

### Abstract:

Current candidate pool is littered with spam.
This is caused by over-reliance on CVs and other market factors, which can be mitigated by introducing novel assessment methods.
By reducing the candidate pool by 90%, we can extract those, who are worth reviewing manually, and automatically but organically reject those, who wouldn't meet skill expectations otherwise.
